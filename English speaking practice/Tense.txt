I wake up in the morning
I go to school
I do not go to college
John does not play cricket
Does she go there
How often she go there?
Does it work
Does he worship
Does she dance?
She cares too much
I study
I meet my friend
I speak English
I go to gym
He teaches English
She dances daily
They play cricket
I often meet him
She regularly comes to school
I worship daily
It rains daily in indore
Ram goes there
This road goes to mumbai
I get ready
I brush my teeth
I do exercise in morning
I take bath
I take breakfast
