I wake up in the morning
I go to school
I do not go to college
John does not play cricket
Does she go there
How often she go there?
Does it work
Does he worship
Does she go to market?
She cares too much
I study
I meet my friend
I speak English
I go to gym
He teaches English
She goes to market daily
They play cricket
I often meet him
She regularly comes to school
I worship daily
It rains daily in indore
Ram goes there
This road goes to mumbai
I get ready
I brush my teeth
I do exercise in morning
I take bath
I take breakfast

how do you learn english

how did you learn

how do you practice
where do you live
what does your father do daily
how does he go to classes
